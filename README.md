This is the third milestone of the project for the game Risk and includes a gui based version with additonal features such as bonus armies(both at the beginning of the turn and for holding continents) AI player, and troupe movement. The authors are Sudaransa Sandeep, Yasin Jaamac, Danish Butt and Yusuf Jaamac. We got our game functioning and one of the known issues is that when the game is played on a mac that the map is slightly covered from the right side and none of the colors show up on the buttons. This issue does not happen when using windows. The map is fully visible and all the colors on the buttons are displayed when using a windows computer. Also, the AI player does attack, fortify, and pass but not troupe movement.

The deliverables included is the source code, jar file, UML class diagram, two UML sequence diagrams, design choices document, user manual, and readMe. We fixed all the known issues from milestone 1, have addressed the TA's feedback and implemented accordingly.

This is the second milestone of the project for the game Risk and this is a gui-based version. The authors are Sudaransa Sandeep, Yasin Jaamac, Danish Butt and Yusuf Jaamac. We got our game functioning and one of the known issues is that when the game is played on a mac that the map is slightly covered from the right side and none of the colors show up on the buttons. This issue does not happen when using windows. The map is fully visible and all the colors on the buttons are displayed when using a windows computer.
The deliverables included is the code, source and executable in a jar file, UML diagrams such as class and sequence, and the documentations combined into a zip file. we fixed all the known issues that were known for milestone 1.
